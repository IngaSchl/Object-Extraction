Process: Main:
	Define map
		Reset
			delete image object level: delete '<all levels>'
			delete layer: delete image layer 'Hue'
			delete layer: delete image layer 'Saturation'
			delete layer: delete image layer 'Value'
			delete layer: delete image layer 'median'
		Generate HSV channels
			color space transformation: RGB > HSV/HSI: color space: R:'Layer 1', 
			G:'Layer 2', B:'Layer 3' -> H:'Hue', S:'Saturation', V:'Value'
		Copy Map for further tests
			copy map: copy map to 'coarser map'
			median filter: on coarser map : median filter (3 x 1): 'Value' => 
			'median'
		Separate background from foreground
			Multi-Threshold on blue channel to extract all edges
				multi-threshold segmentation: multi-threshold: creating 'New 
				Level': boundaries <= 145 < remainder on Layer 3
			Extract buildings
				Define building objects by small dot texture
					find enclosed by class: boundaries with Area <= 4 Pxl at New 
					Level: enclosed by remainder: New +
					Create layer which contains nearby small dot texture pixels 
					(only those areas are supposed to be buildings)
						create temporary image layer: New with Distance to New 
						< 10 Pxl at New Level: create temp. image layer 
						'temp_distanceNew<10' using 'Distance to New'
					Classify those areas containing the pre-defined dots into 
					'buildings'
						assign class: remainder with Existence of New (0) >= 1  
						and Area < 7000 Pxl at New Level: Texture
				Close gaps of boundaries
					pixel-based object resizing: 2x: boundaries at New Level: 
					grow into remainder
				Classify 'Remainder' with clutter as 'Buildings' once again
					assign class: remainder with Existence of New (0) >= 1  and 
					Area < 6000 Pxl and Compactness (polygon) >= 0.1  at New 
					Level: Texture
				Bring 'Boundaries' back to former image objects (before closing 
				their gaps)
					multi-threshold segmentation: boundaries at New Level: New 
					<= 145 < remainder on Layer 3
					Reclassify 'Temp' into 'Texture'
						assign class: New at New Level: boundaries
		Separate water from remainder
			Extract typical water texture (with the aid of narrow, longish (not 
			too long) splinters)
				find enclosed by class: boundaries with Length <= 20 Pxl and Width 
				<= 3 Pxl and Length >= 10 Pxl at New Level: enclosed by remainder, 
				Texture: 'Water'+
			Classify segments into 'Water' if they are adjacent to this extracted 
			water texture
				assign class: with Existence of 'Water' (0) >= 1  at New Level: 
				'Water'
			Classify enclosed segments (by Water) also into 'Water'
				find enclosed by class: at New Level: enclosed by 'Water': 
				‘Water’+
				merge region: 'Water' at New Level: merge region
			Classify 'Remainder' which is adjacent to 'Water' also as 'Water'
				assign class: remainder with Existence of 'Water' (0) >= 1  at 				New Level: ‘Water’
				assign class: 5x: remainder with Existence of 'Water' (0) >= 1  
				and Area < 500 Pxl at New Level: 'Water'
			Classify enclosed segments (by Water) also into 'Water'
				find enclosed by class: at New Level: enclosed by 'Water': 
				'Water'+
			Merge 'Water' objects
				merge region: 'Water' at New Level: merge region
		Separate labels within bounding boxes from background
			vector-based segmentation: at New Level: vector-based segmentation 
			using BBs
			assign class by thematic layer: at New Level: assign class by thematic 
			layer using "layer"
			merge region: Labels at New Level: merge region
		Convert class 'Labels' to 'Remainder' resp. 'Texture'
			Classify label as 'Texture' or 'Remainder'
				Texture
					assign class: Labels with Rel. border to Texture >= 0.5  at 
					New Level: Texture
				Remainder
					assign class: Labels with Rel. border to remainder >= 0.5  
					at New Level: remainder
			merge region: remainder at New Level: merge region
		Improve 'Water'
			Remove 'Texture' at edges of water
				assign class: Texture with Border to 'Water' >= 1 Pxl at New 
				Level: 'Water'
			Remove 'Remainder' at edges of water
				assign class: remainder with Border to 'Water' >= 1 Pxl and Area 
				< 700 Pxl at New Level: 'Water'
			Remove 'Boundaries' at edges of water
				assign class: boundaries with Border to 'Water' >= 1 Pxl and Area 
				< 500 Pxl at New Level: 'Water'
			Convert objects completely enclosed by water also to 'Water'
				find enclosed by class: at New Level: enclosed by 'Water': 
				'Water'+
			Remove 'Texture' within 'Water'
				find enclosed by image object: 'Water' at New Level: enclosed by 
				domain: 'Water'+
			merge 'Water' objects
				merge region: 'Water' at New Level: merge region
		Improve 'Texture' within buildings
			Remove small enclosed segments
				find enclosed by class: at New Level: enclosed by Texture: 
				Texture+
				merge region: Texture at New Level: merge region
		Improve 'Boundaries' by reclassifying them into other classes
			multi-threshold segmentation: boundaries at New Level: New <= 0.5 < 
			boundaries on Value
			'Water'
			assign class: boundaries with Rel. border to New >= 0.2  and Rel. border 
			to 'Water' >= 0.2  at New Level: 'Water'
				assign class: boundaries with Rel. border to 'Water' >= 0.1  and 
				Rel. border to Texture < 0.05  at New Level: 'Water'
				assign class: 5x: boundaries with Number of 'Water' (0) >= 1  at 
				New Level: 'Water'
				find enclosed by class: at New Level: enclosed by 'Water': 
				'Water'+
				merge region: 'Water' at New Level: merge region
			'Texture'
				assign class: boundaries with Rel. border to Texture > 0.11  and 
				Rel. border to 'Water' <= 0.3  at New Level: Texture
				merge region: Texture at New Level: merge region
			Convert 'Temp' to 'Boundaries'
				assign class: New at New Level: boundaries
			merge region: boundaries at New Level: merge region
